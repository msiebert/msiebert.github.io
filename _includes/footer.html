            Hi, I'm Mark! By day, I'm a backend software engineer working for <a href="https://www.golucid.co">Lucid Software</a>. By night, I'm a husband, a <a href="https://lds.org">Mormon</a>, and a baker. I'm <i>always</i> proudly half Taiwanese. I don't really believe in social media, but you can check me out on Github or LinkedIn (which I hate, but people tell me it's important).
