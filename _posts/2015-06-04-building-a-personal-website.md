So I did it. After months of feeling like I should make one, I now have a personal website (in case you were wondering, this is it).

Writing this website was an interesting experience. It's served by Github Pages. Technically, it's a very simple website. The CSS is simple, and I don't do anything really special with the Liquid templating system. The main difficultly I had was in designing the look of the website. I'm a backend developer by trade and haven't had much practice making things that look nice (to be honest, based only on the work I do at my job, one would think the only UI I'm capable of designing for is curl and the command line).

When I started, I knew I wanted to use *Binary Nirvana* as the name of my website, as I had used the same name when I was required to blog for a CS class in college. I originally wanted to have a nice green zen feel (I was going for an "elegant" look), but found I was unable to really visualize a unique look. So ultimately, I decided to go with a simple look and use the fish logo to accentuate the "Asian-ness" of the site. It was hard enough to even come up with a simple design.

But it's done now, and I think it looks relatively nice. My next task is to make it responsive. It shouldn't be terribly difficult, but you never know. Let me know if you have any suggestions for how I could make the site better!
